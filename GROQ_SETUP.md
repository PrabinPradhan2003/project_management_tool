## ‚úÖ Testing Your Setup

1. Log in to your application
2. Navigate to "AI Stories" from the navbar
3. Enter a project description, for example:
   ```
   An ecommerce website where customers can browse products, 
   add to cart, and make payments online. Admin should manage 
   products and view orders.
   ```
4. Click "Generate User Stories"
5. You should see AI-generated user stories appear!

## üéØ Available Models

GROQ supports several models. The default in our code is:
- **llama-3.3-70b-versatile** (Recommended - Fast & High Quality)

Other options you can use (change in `aiController.js`):
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768` - Great for long context
- `llama3-70b-8192` - Balanced performance
- `llama3-8b-8192` - Faster, lighter model

## üí° Free Tier Limits

GROQ's free tier includes:
- 14,400 requests per day
- 30 requests per minute
- More than enough for development and testing!

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit your API key to Git**
   - Already handled in `.gitignore`
   
2. **Use environment variables**
   - Always store keys in `.env` file
   
3. **Regenerate if exposed**
   - If you accidentally expose your key, regenerate it immediately

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid API Key"
- Double-check you copied the entire key
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Verify the key is set in `.env` file

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
- You've hit the free tier limit
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading if needed

### Error: "GROQ_API_KEY is not defined"
- Make sure `.env` file exists in `backend/` folder
- Restart your backend server after adding the key
- Check that `dotenv` is configured in `server.js`
